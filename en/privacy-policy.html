      <h1 class="mb-4">Privacy Policy</h1>
      <h5 class="mb-4">General Notice and Mandatory Information</h5>
      <h5 class="mb-4">Designation of the Responsible Party</h5>
      <p>
        The responsible party for data processing on this website is: <br /><br />
        Traditional Thai Massage<br />
        Dararat Lischka<br />
        Alexanderstrasse 121<br />
        52062 Aachen <br />
        <br />
        The responsible party decides alone or jointly with others on the purposes and means of processing personal data
        (e.g., names, contact details, etc.).
      </p>

      <h5>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h5>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Some data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent that you
        have already given at any time. An informal email notification is sufficient to revoke your consent. The
        legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
      </p>

      <h5>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h5>
      <p class="mb-4">
        As a data subject, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority in the event
        of a data protection violation. The competent supervisory authority regarding data protection issues is the
        State Data Protection Commissioner of the federal state where our company is headquartered. The following link
        provides a list of Data Protection Officers and their contact details:

          target="_blank">https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html</a>.
      </p>

      <h5>Right to Data Portability</h5>
      <p class="mb-4">
        You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of
        a contract handed over to you or to third parties. The provision is made in a machine-readable format. If you
        request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done insofar as it is
        technically feasible.
      </p>

      <h5>Right to Information, Correction, Blocking, Deletion</h5>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information
        about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient, and the purpose of data processing and, if necessary,
        a right to correction, blocking, or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions on
        the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time using the contact options listed in the imprint.
      </p>

      <h5>SSL or TLS Encryption</h5>
      <p class="mb-4">
        For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content that you send to us as the site
        operator, our website uses SSL or TLS encryption. This means that data you transmit via this website cannot be
        read by third parties. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the "https://" address line of your browser
        and the lock symbol in the browser line.
      </p>

      <h5>Server Log Files</h5>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The provider of this website automatically collects and stores information in server log files that your browser
        automatically transmits to us. These are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li class="mb-1">Pages visited on our domain</li>
        <li class="mb-1">Date and time of the server request</li>
        <li class="mb-1">Browser type and version</li>
        <li class="mb-1">Operating system used</li>
        <li class="mb-1">Referrer URL</li>
        <li class="mb-1">Hostname of the accessing computer</li>
        <li class="mb-1">IP address</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mb-4">
        This data is not merged with other data sources. The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR, which
        permits the processing of data for the fulfillment of a contract or pre-contractual measures.
      </p>

      <h5>Cookies</h5>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Our website uses cookies. These are small text files that your web browser stores on your device. Cookies help
        us make our offering more user-friendly, effective, and secure. Some cookies are "session cookies," which are
        automatically deleted after your browser session. Other cookies remain stored on your device until you delete
        them. These cookies enable us to recognize your browser on your next visit. With a modern web browser, you can
        monitor, restrict, or prevent the setting of cookies. Many web browsers can be configured to automatically
        delete cookies when the program is closed. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of our website. The
        setting of cookies that are necessary for the execution of electronic communication processes or the provision
        of certain functions you request (e.g., shopping cart) is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. As the operator of this
        website, we have a legitimate interest in storing cookies for the technically error-free and smooth provision of
        our services. If the setting of other cookies (e.g., for analysis functions) occurs, these will be treated
        separately in this privacy policy.
